# 2d-Tree
2-dimensional tree implementation with efficient range search (find all of the points
contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest
point to a query point).

This code dependends on algs4 library from Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
It's can be downloaded from [HERE](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

### TODO:
- need optimization for KdTree.nearest() method
